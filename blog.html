  <h2>My Vipassana practice in the past 8 years:</h2>

  <p>Accounting for the 8 years I have been practicing meditation and the question must be asked, would I continue to waste 2 hours a day sitting idle while the world passes by?
  The answer is a definite yes and here are reasons why.

  Practicing twice a day, one hour in the early morning and one hour at night sounds like a big effort and it is, but the improvement is gradual and so small that you don’t see it.
  </p>
  <h2>The benefit of sitting daily are below, for me anyway:</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>After each sit your mind reset and cleared up, at times last for the whole day</li>
    <li>Ability to see your anger arises and passes away, and a lot of time before it becomes anger</li>
    <li>Sitting quietly listening to your head sometimes yield a few surprising novel ideas and a lot of my problems were solved while sitting. (sitting here refer to meditating)</li>
    <li>Sitting has helped so much with the everyday emotional challenges</li>
    <li>Ability to recharge yourself mentally and physically with a quick 10min meditation</li>
    <li>Sleep is generally not a problem for me, but having the ability to get your body to sleep and your mind awake is kind of cool</li>
    <li>During a big emotional even, sitting brings it to light and you become more consumed in it, meditation/sitting let you see the way you react to it and eventually it will subside. This is not a peaceful and lah lah land kind of way but more
      like of put on your armor and using all the skills gained, essentially try as hard as you could to see the emotion, see the reactions, see how the sensations in your body react to it, like you study your body and sensation.</li>

  </ul>

  Taking a break from it however has a much more noticeable effect. It took a lot of time and effort to work toward to a regular 2 hour sit, and in the past year with I have been missing a whole chunk of sittings and like any exercise if the muscle
  hasn’t been in used in a while and its starting to grow weaker. This is evident at some of the emotions up and down that I have been experiencing.
  I can see that emotions like anger and frustration got to me more often than before, generally moody and like to look for escape rather than living the now.
  Not all is lost however, the years of practice have given me a perspective with emotions that others don’t normally have, I can see emotions like frustration play out from starting from the sensation or sometime trigger, seeing myself in these
  situation reminds me that I have to do more work on myself.
  Generally, greed, anger and ignorance are somewhat lessened from this meditation, for me anyway.
  I get to deal with my emotions during the 2 hours sit, one in the morning and one at night, I get to work on these emotions and see it the way it is.
  Emotions like happy and joy I can’t say that I have more of it, life is so subjective that I can’t compare. But what I can say is that the craving for these emotions is lessen and replace with contentment.
  The result of this meditation is taking the edge out of emotions, and same goes with desires, it was lower than before, but this doesn’t mean it’s not there, the proper way to describe it was there is more control of it than before.
